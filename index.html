         Im Ralp S. Iguid a Grade 12 ICT student with a goal of having a financially stable life alongside my gf.
          I spend most of my time playing online games and hanging out with my friends. Though i spend a lot of
         my time playing online games, i also love playing sports like billiards and basketball. Studying is also
         a thing i enjoy but is having a hard time with subjects such as Practical Research and Math related subjects.

      <h2> Academic Achievement </h2>
      <p>
         I am performing poorly academically when i was on the Grade levels of 7 to 8. My grades went up in flames
         because of my procrastination and not being able to manage my time proficiently. I decided to improve my
         academic perfomance by studying even harder. When i transitioned to the 9th level my grades improved 
         and i found enjoyment in studing. Afterwards, I became a consistent honored student that prioritizes his
         studying. My road to greatness started when i got a 94 grade as my general average. The consistency in my
         performance has greatly improved and i was awarded with a Bronze Seal in three consecutive quarters with      
         a Silver Seal on the fourth quarter
